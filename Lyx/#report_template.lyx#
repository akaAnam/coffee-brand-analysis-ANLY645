\paragraph_spacing other 0.9
\noindent
Coffee is one of the most-consumed products worldwide and is provided by
 both well-known large companies and small boutique stores.
 Of the many popular beverages on the market, coffee appears unique in the
 sense that people often find identity and feel strong loyalty toward their
 coffee brand of choice, claiming to be a “small coffee shop person”, a
 “Starbucks person”, an “artisanal coffee person”, etc.
 To understand the sentiments and overlap of coffee identities and identify
 other key characteristics of brand loyalties, this study utilizes tweets
 about two major coffee brands: “Starbucks” and “Dunkin Donuts”.
 Ten thousand tweets are collected regarding each coffee brand and textually
 broken down into significant words.
 For each tweet, metadata is collected regarding the tweet user’s follower
 counts, the tweet’s retweet counts, and more.
 Then, text analysis is used to score each tweet’s sentiment (negative,
 neutral, positive).
 Finally, a network is created connecting tweets by their textual commonalities.
 Network analysis is performed to understand each brand’s clientele and
 investigate similarities and differences between the brands and their consumers
’ sentiments and attributes.
 The results provide insights into these brands’ consumers and a template
 for similar analyses of other brands.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Coffee is one of the most-consumed products worldwide and has developed
 into a major international market.
 Over the past few decades, the consumption of coffee has changed from a
 purely practical activity into a cultural and personal experience.
 Both large-scale coffee houses such as Starbucks and local single-store
 coffee shops continue to boom in popularity and patron loyalty.
 World consumption of coffee is currently projected to increase from roughly
 9.9 billion kilograms in the 2020/21 coffee year to 10.2 billion kilograms
 in the 2021/22 coffee year (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "ICO2022"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 With this growing market and increase in popularity, consumers have begun
 to find identity in their chosen coffee brands.
 A sense of pride is established in a person’s claim to being a Starbucks
 loyalist or a small-shop artisanal coffee connoisseur.
 Hence, several distinct groups of coffee-drinkers have naturally formed.
 And with the advent of third wave coffee, a higher emphasis is being placed
 on higher quality coffee.
 As marketers now try to bring this higher quality coffee to the masses,
 opinions toward tried and true establishments with often cult-like followings
 might be subject to change.
 
\begin_inset VSpace defskip

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mass consumption of coffee has led to many studies regarding coffee
 in terms of its consumption and marketplace.
 A 2018 investigation into the existing research done regarding coffee consumpti
on found that most researchers looked into the sustainability and ethical
 aspects of coffee consumption (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Samoggia2018"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 Following that topic, the next most researched area revolved around “consumer
 behavior towards coffeehouse brands, mainly Starbucks” (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Samoggia2018"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 This area of research aligns with the focus of this study.
 The investigation herein uses text and network analytics of Twitter data
 to understand consumer identities and sentiments toward two of the largest
 coffee brands in the United States: Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts.
 Additionally, through tweets posted about each of these brands, this study
 aims to identify common attributes of the critics and proponents of the
 two brands, respectively and comparatively, and how these consumers interact
 and relate.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before diving into the details of the project objective, a deep literature
 review is performed to understand the applications and background of the
 topic and what methodology could be considered.
 Furthermore, researching previous studies aid in understanding limitations
 to the study and provide motivation for why this research is important.
 The literature review provides use cases for the study and a foundation
 of previous work to grow off of.
 
\begin_inset VSpace defskip

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One application of this study is to understand marketing directions that
 a company (namely, Starbucks or Dunkin’ Donuts) could apply to better reach
 out to both their loyal fans and their critics.
 By targeting these two groups in unique ways, marketing efforts can be
 optimized.
 Understanding consumer perceptions of brands is an essential component
 of marketing strategy that marketing managers have long relied on to inform
 marketing strategy (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "john2006brand,lehmann2008structure"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 Because of this, developing improvements to perceptual mapping techniques,
 a method of visualizing how customers rank a company holistically and comparati
vely with other companies, have been a priority for marketing researchers
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "bijmolt2012multiattribute"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 However, manually collecting data about consumer perceptions has historically
 been very difficult and expensive due to the need for recruiting study
 participants and maintaining participant attention and cooperation throughout
 the study (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "steenkamp1997attribute"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 Considering these challenges, the rise of social media has laid a pathway
 for new methods of data collection.
\begin_inset VSpace defskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Social media has redefined the marketing landscape by changing how information
 about consumer perceptions is collected.
 Now, marketers can examine consumer opinions by collecting textual evidence
 about thoughts toward and interactions with the product.
 Not only can marketers absorb information about their consumers, but they
 can also use social media to distribute messages to their consumers about
 their products and services.
 To investigate this, a 2021 study analyzed the Twitter networks of two
 multi-brand retailers to investigate network activities and network patterns
 based on centrality and betweenness (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "watanabe2021social"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 The study utilized network statistics to examine the ego networks (brand-center
ed) and whole networks (hashtag networks) produced via social media communicatio
ns (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "watanabe2021social"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 The findings revealed that although brands are able to deliver messages
 through digital platforms, they have limited control over the communication
 within networks, and thus cannot govern the spread of information (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "watanabe2021social"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 This suggests that marketing teams need to dive deeper into optimizing
 their methodology for effectively spreading information on social media.
 One way to do this would be through the collection of consumer thoughts
 regarding their product and producing material targeted at certain attributes
 of groups.
 Thus, understanding this idea is critical to the ways in which this study
 could be applied.
 One way this study plans to apply the findings of the aforementioned literature
, is to analyze sentiments towards Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts consumers
 and whether negative or positive sentiments are clustered together based
 on group attributes.
 This could aid and validate the use of market segmentation strategies in
 favor against a “one size fits all” approach.
 For instance, when determining which characteristics individuals in different
 groups should have, and when curating unique messages to advertise to these
 different groups of consumers.

\begin_layout Standard
While marketers may not be able to control the inter-communications of their
 consumers regarding their product, it is clear that social media has revolution
ized how information in a networked environment is received and disseminated.
 In particular, Twitter has generated a great deal of attention for its
 ability to broadly propagate information to a large audience.
 Information diffusion, the process of how information is spread and interacted,
 has been widely studied in the field of network science.
 Information is often diffused in conjunction with a major event such as
 an earthquake or a political demonstration (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "sakaki2010earthquake,beguerisse2014interest"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 Studies following the dissemination of information after a major event
 map the network of tweets, mentions, and retweets to identify the popularity
 and measure influence.
 While this may seem straightforward, tweets are not always indicative of
 a user’s connection with a topic or their community identity due to the
 noise produced by many personal messages, jokes, and fanfares.
 Therefore, there is a need to transform into a more structured network
 in terms of “community” (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "myers2014information"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 This idea is important to keep in mind as a limiting reagent to the study
 here, as analyzing Twitter networks must be done carefully and very analyticall
y to filter through the noise and gain true insights.
\begin_inset VSpace defskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the detection of communities may be challenging, understanding
 the sentiments of consumers has the potential to provide valuable insights
 about the consumer perspectives on products.
 Sentiment analysis has long been used in the commercial space, especially
 on product reviews and predicting future buying behaviors.
 One study on this topic compared tweets containing two different hashtags
 related to weight loss (#thinspiration and #fitspiration) in order to understan
d how users’ views on health and fitness differed for each group (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "tiggemann2018strong,tiggemann2018tweeting"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 Analysis of the sentiments of each set of tweets showed that on average,
 both #thinspiration and #fitspiration tweets were mildly positive in sentiment
 but that #fitspiration tweets were significantly more positive than #thinspirat
ion tweets (Tiggmann & Zac-cardo 2018).
 This is consistent with the findings that much of the text on #fitspiration
 Instagram imagery is positive, suggesting that the text may be the source
 of inspiration that people feel (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "tiggemann2018strong,tiggemann2018tweeting"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 Considering this study, it is established that sentiments can be evaluated
 and useful in comparing tweets on two different yet similar topics.
 This validates the basis of this research topic.
 
\begin_inset VSpace defskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sentiment analysis also plays a role in building quantitative measures of
 users’ attitudes towards brands as well as underlying business components
 such as product, website, support and customer service.
 Another study analyzed the opinion of 19 million Twitter users towards
 62 popular industries, encompassing 12,898 enterprise and consumer brands
 via sentiment analysis of 330 million tweets over a period of one month
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "hu2017analyzing"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 The study found that users tended to be more positive or negative when
 interacting with brands than in general on Twitter but that the sentiment
 towards brands between and within industries varied greatly (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "hu2017analyzing"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 For example, airline industries produce very high negative sentiments and
 Automotive industries provide high positive sentiment (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "hu2017analyzing"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 By analyzing sentiment towards topics associated with users’ brand interaction
 tweets, the authors found that highly negative topics included “Fox News”
 while highly positive topics include “Video Games” and “Music” (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "hu2017analyzing"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 The results of this study suggest that evaluating sentiments about products
 on Twitter produce valuable insights and it is important to compare brands
 within the same industry.
 Again, this solidifies the direction of this research project’s ideation.
\begin_inset VSpace defskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before diving more into the basis of this project, the world-wide nature
 of coffee as an industry was investigated to confirm the international
 nature of this consumer product.
 One study looked at the dynamics of the international coffee trade network
 using data from the World Trade Organization from 1996 to 2017 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "sujaritpong2021analysis"
literal "true"

\end_inset

) .
 They found that more than 82% of countries participated in the coffee trade
 network but only 3% of countries controlled more than 90% of international
 trade (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "sujaritpong2021analysis"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 Understanding the vast nature of the coffee industry is important to validate
 that this topic is a good representation of how tweets can be used to understan
d consumer sentiments toward products.
 Thus, the methodology of this study could be replicated with other major
 consumer products to gain insights about them.
\begin_inset VSpace defskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With a review of literature validating the ideation of this project, a firm
 objective can be stated.
 This research study aims to understand and compare consumer sentiments
 and identities surrounding two popular coffee brands: Starucks and Dunkin’
 Donuts.
 Several questions are sought to be answered.
 Are there distinguishable communities in a coffee-based social network?
 If so, what characteristics do they share? Are Starbucks/Dunkin’ drinkers
 more/less positive/negative? Do people prefer Starbucks or Dunkin’ Donuts?
 Is there an “influencer” effect on coffee brand preference? These questions
 will be answered through a network analysis of ten thousand tweets about
 each of the two brands.
 For each tweet, metadata is collected regarding the tweet user’s follower
 counts, the tweet’s retweet counts, and more.
 Then, text analysis is used to score each tweet’s sentiment (negative,
 neutral, positive).
 Finally, a network is created connecting tweets by their commonalities.
 Network analysis is performed to understand each brand’s clientele and
 investigate commonalities and differences between the brands and their
 consumers’ sentiments and attributes.
 The results provide insights into these brands and a template for similar
 analysis of other brands.
