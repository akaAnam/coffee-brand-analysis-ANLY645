	abstract = {This paper presents a systematic literature review of consumer research towards coffee with the objective to identify and categorize motives, preferences and attributes of coffee consumption and purchasing behavior. Research papers were analyzed in terms of main characteristics and components (study type, research methodology, sampling, and product type). The review gives a systematic overview of the heterogeneous group of concepts and approaches that have been used so far to examine consumer behavior towards coffee. Results provide a model of key determinants for coffee consumption that can be grouped into the categories, (1) personal preferences, (2) economic attributes, (3) product attributes, (4) context of consumption, and (5) socio-demographics. The findings also show that there is a strong focus on coffee sustainability.},

@article{watanabe2021social,
	abstract = {As brands' use of social media to connect with customers becomes increasingly important, there is a need to continually monitor social network activities. Although numerous studies have examined consumer behaviors on social media, only a handful of studies have adopted a social network analysis approach. Considering this gap, the current study analyzed Twitter networks of two multi-brand retailers to investigate network activities. The findings from analyzing network patterns reveal that while brands are able to deliver messages through digital platforms, they may only have limited control over the communications within networks, and thus cannot govern the spread of information.},

@article{hu2017analyzing,
	abstract = {Social media serves as a unified platform for users to express their thoughts on subjects ranging from their daily lives to their opinion on consumer brands and products. These users wield an enormous influence in shaping the opinions of other consumers and influence brand perception, brand loyalty and brand advocacy. In this paper, we analyze the opinion of 19M Twitter users towards 62 popular industries, encompassing 12,898 enterprise and consumer brands, as well as associated subject matter topics, via sentiment analysis of 330M tweets over a period spanning a month. We find that users tend to be most positive towards manufacturing and most negative towards service industries. In addition, they tend to be more positive or negative when interacting with brands than generally on Twitter. We also find that sentiment towards brands within an industry varies greatly and we demonstrate this using two industries as use cases. In addition, we discover that there is no strong correlation between topic sentiments of different industries, demonstrating that topic sentiments are highly dependent on the context of the industry that they are mentioned in. We demonstrate the value of such an analysis in order to assess the impact of brands on social media. We hope that this initial study will prove valuable for both researchers and companies in understanding users' perception of industries, brands and associated topics and encourage more research in this field.},

To gain greater insight into this potential, this study investigates how consumers' relationships with brands influence their engagement in retweeting brand messages on Twitter. Data from a survey of 315 Korean consumers who currently follow brands on Twitter show that those who retweet brand messages outscore those who do not on brand identifica- tion, brand trust, community commitment, community membership intention, Twitter usage frequency, and total number of postings.},

	abstract = {We employ network theory to study the structure, topology, and spectral properties of the coffee trade network. Data from the world trade organization is used to create a year- wise network of coffee trade from 1996 to 2017. More than 82% of world countries participate in the coffee trade network but only 3% of countries control more than 90% of international trade. The networks are very sparse operating at less than 10% of its efficiency. The coffee network shows scale-free behavior. Spectral analysis on the network is performed which shows that the eigenvalue dynamics of adjacency and Laplacian matrices can capture the crisis and stress period of the global economy.},

	abstract = {Blogs and social networks have recently become a valuable resource for mining sentiments in fields as diverse as customer relationship management, public opinion tracking and text filtering. In fact knowledge obtained from social networks such as Twitter and Facebook has been shown to be extremely valuable to marketing research companies, public opinion organizations and other text mining entities. However, Web texts have been classified as noisy as they represent considerable problems both at the lexical and the syntactic levels. In this research we used a random sample of 3516 tweets to evaluate consumers' sentiment towards well-known brands such as Nokia, T-Mobile, IBM, KLM and DHL. We used an expert-predefined lexicon including around 6800 seed adjectives with known orientation to conduct the analysis. Our results indicate a generally positive consumer sentiment towards several famous brands. By using both a qualitative and quantitative methodology to analyze brands' tweets, this study adds breadth and depth to the debate over attitudes towards cosmopolitan brands.},

@article{grandjean2016social,
	abstract = {Defining digital humanities might be an endless debate if we stick to the discussion about the boundaries of this concept as an academic ``discipline''. In an attempt to concretely identify this field and its actors, this paper shows that it is possible to analyse them through Twitter, a social media widely used by this ``com- munity of practice''. Based on a network analysis of 2,500 users identified as mem- bers of this movement, the visualisation of the ``who's following who?'' graph allows us to highlight the structure of the network's relationships, and identify users whose position is particular. Specifically, we show that linguistic groups are key factors to explain clustering within a network whose characteristics look similar to a small world.},

	abstract = {Thinspiration and fitspiration represent contemporary online trends designed to inspire viewers towards the thin ideal or towards health and fitness respectively. The aim of the present study was to compare thinspiration and fitspiration communities on Twitter. A total of 3289 English-language tweets with hashtags related to thinspiration (n = 1181) and fitspiration (n = 2578) were collected over a two-week period. Network analysis showed minimal overlap between the communities on Twitter, with the thin- spiration community more closely-connected and having greater information flow than the fitspiration community. Frequency counts and sentiment analysis showed that although the tweets from both types of accounts focused on appearance and weight loss, fitspiration tweets were significantly more positive in sentiment. It was concluded that the thinspiration tweeters, unlike the fitspiration tweeters, represent a genuine on-line community on Twitter. Such a community of support may have negative consequences for collective body image and disordered eating identity.},

@article{bello2017detecting,
	abstract = {Vaccines have contributed to dramatically decrease mortality from infectious diseases in the 20th century. However, several social discussion groups related to vaccines have emerged, influencing the opinion of the population about vaccination for the past 20 years. These communities discussing on vaccines have taken advantage of social media to effectively disseminate their theories. Nowadays, recent outbreaks of preventable diseases such as measles, polio, or influenza, have shown the effect of a decrease in vaccination rates. Social Networks are one of the most important sources of Big Data. Specifically, Twitter generates over 400 million tweets every day. Data mining provides the necessary algorithms and techniques to analyse massive data and to discover new knowledge. This work proposes the use of these techniques to detect and track discussion communities on vaccination arising from Social Networks. Firstly, a preliminary analysis using data from Twitter and official vaccination coverage rates is performed, showing how vaccine opinions of Twitter users can influence over vaccination decision-making. Then, algorithms for community detection are applied to discover user groups opining about vaccines. The experimental results show that these techniques can be used to discover social discussion communities providing useful information to improve immunization strategies. Public Healthcare Organizations may try to use the detection and tracking of these social communities to avoid or mitigate new outbreaks of eradicated diseases.},
